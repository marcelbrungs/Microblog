# Microblog

Project members included: Marcel Brungs / Kuba Moszkowicz / Krysztof Czaja 

Marcel Brungs  - done part of Lab 2 & then Lab 3,4,5 and redid Lab 7 and checked Lab 8
Kuba Moszkowicz - Provided Support for Lab 4,5 & did Lab 6 along with Lab 8
Kryzstof Czaja - Did a Task in Lab 2 / Followed up to do Lab 7 but had to be redone.

Project was listed from last year till end date: 2/6/2022

In short the Microblog has many errors and does not function yet, however the code and steps along with the experience gained from creating a Server and testing SQL along with Maven was challenging thus making it a fun interesting project despite its difficulty.

Kind Regards
Marcel Brungs
